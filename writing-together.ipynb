        "abstract: In today's data-centric world, writing has evolved beyond static pages. Many of us rely on code-enabled documents (think `.ipynb` notebooks or Quarto `.qmd` files) to combine text, data analysis, and visuals in one place. Yet these documents can alienate those who don't code. Those who shape ideas, refine language, or provide domain expertise—without touching the code. Resolve was developed to lower the barrier for non-coders, the synthesists, while keepig the dociment, and the text close to the source data, facilitating the analists. Resolve is an online texteditor developed with one goal in mind, broadening access to collaborative scientific and creative writing for everyone.\n",

        "**Knuth** introduced the idea of literate programming decades ago[@knuth1984]: the premise that our code and our explanation shouldn’t live in separate corners. Now, with data-driven science at the forefront, there’s a dire need for writers, editors, domain experts, journalists—to join the conversation without drowning in code. By bridging that gap, we empower more voices and guarantee a more inclusive final results. Trough literate programming enables **mixing words and data**— in science and journalism.\n",

        "Many of today's data analysis tools, like Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) and Quarto (`.qmd`) let us weave code and and text into a single document. Literate programming, merges narrative and computation, letting readers follow the logic behind every figure and result. It's a powerful concept: you write your story while code chunks generate your tables, plots, or transformations in real time.\n",

Literate programming takes place in code oriented text editors, or in explicit programming tools like integrated development environments (IDEs). Its and effort to meet halfway between data an prose, but why meet halfway when we can have it both ways?\n",

Hence there are two kinds of method, one for discovering the truth, which is known as analysis, or the method of resolution, and which can also be called the method of discovery. The other is for making the truth understood by others once it is found. This is known as synthesis, or the method of composition, and can also be called the method of instruction.\" [@arnauld1996]\n",

Instead, I we need a **gentle wrapper**—a place where non-coders can come in, highlight a paragraph, reorganize headings, or refine language. Think a “word processor layer” over literate programming. The file remains a `.ipynb` notebook at heart, but collaborators edits trough a friendlier interface, and interface that offers the creature comfort of a modern word editor, like tracked changes and comments.\n",
